“Lorem ipsum” dummy text is used by many web-developers to test how their HTML templates will look with real data. Often, developers use third-party services to generate “Lorem ipsum” text, but now you can do that right in your editor. Just expand lorem or lipsum abbreviations to get the following snippet:

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Eligendi non quis exercitationem culpa nesciunt nihil aut nostrum explicabo reprehenderit optio amet ab temporibus asperiores quasi cupiditate. Voluptatum ducimus voluptates voluptas?
lorem is not just a normal snippet—it’s actually a generator. Every time you expand it, it will generate a 30-words dummy text, splitted into a few sentences.

You can specify how many words should be generated right in the abbreviation. For example, lorem100 will generate a 100-words dummy text.
